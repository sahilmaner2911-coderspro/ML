Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using machine learning techniques based on patient health data. The goal is to assist in early diagnosis by analyzing medical attributes and providing accurate predictions through a trained ML model.

📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection can help save lives. This project uses supervised machine learning algorithms to analyze health parameters such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, heart rate, and more to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease.
